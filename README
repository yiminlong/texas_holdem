Telnet Holdem is a Texas Holdem Poker game server that allows people to
connect and play with each other using their telnet clients.

Written purely as a way to test and build my own C development skills.

You can play the game by simple downloading the software, building and executing
it and then players can join by simply pointing their client telent clients
at the server's ip and port.

Telnet holdem is written in C and uses basic object orientated techniques to
express the business logic and demonstrates the use of network sockets and using
poll() to manage multiple socket connections in a single thread.
